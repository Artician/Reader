A program designed to explore the possibility of summarizing a given text file. 
This file uses several different projects that I have no connection with, including the Project Gutenberg plaintext version of the 
Webster's English Dictionary and first20hours's collection of the top 10,000 english words. Currently this has several different
parts, each developed independently.
